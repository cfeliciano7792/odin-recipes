# odin-recipes
In this project I will use HTML to build a basic recipe website. The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. I plan to revisit this website once I have learned more CSS in order to make the website look nicer.

Project goals:
Using the correct tags
    <p> paragraph
    <strong> bold
    <em>italic

Succesfully adding links and images
   

Including comments in my code

Using the proper tags to make lists
        <ol>ordered list</ol>
        <ul>unordered list</ul>
        <li>listed item<li>
