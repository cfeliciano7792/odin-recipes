    <h1>Key Lime Pie</h1>
    <img src="../images/key_lime_pie.jpeg">

    <p>This recipe uses condensed milk and sour cream. Fabulously 
        easy and a summertime favorite! If you have time, a homemade 
        graham cracker crust is better! Garnish with whipped cream 
        and thin slices of lime if you like.
