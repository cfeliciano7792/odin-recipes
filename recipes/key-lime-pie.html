    <img src="../images/key_lime_pie.jpeg">

    <p>Key Lime Pies are the most iconic dessert in the Florida Keys. If you are
        are not heading down to Florida any time soon this recipe is an 
        easy replacement to hold you over! If you have time, a homemade 
        graham cracker crust is better! Garnish with whipped cream 
        and thin slices of lime if you like.
